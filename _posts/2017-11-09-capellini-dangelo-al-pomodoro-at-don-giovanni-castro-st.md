![Capellini D'Angelo al Pomodoro](http://blogs.kenichikurihara.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/IMG_20171029_190346-e1509495550503-300x204.jpg)I often visit Don Giovanni when I visit Mountain View. I like their pasta in general. They don't overcook pasta, which I sometimes unfortunately see in other Italian restaurants in the US. This time, I have tried their capellini. It was good as I hoped. I added chicken which was extra, and it was a good choice, too. I probably visit the place again sometime.
